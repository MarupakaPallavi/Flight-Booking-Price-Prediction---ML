# Flight Booking Price Prediction

The objective is to analyze the flight
booking dataset obtained from a
platform which is used to book flight
tickets. 

A thorough study of the data
will aid in the discovery of valuable
insights that will be of enormous
value to passengers.

 Apply EDA,
statistical methods and Machine
learning algorithms in order to get
meaningful information from it


## Data set

**Airline** - Name of the airline company

**Flight** - Plane's flight code

**Source City** - City from which the flight takes off

**Departure** - Time Time of Departure

**Stops** - Number of stops between the source and destination cities

**Arrival Time** - Time of Arrival

**Destination City** - City where the flight will land

**Class** - Contains information on seat class

**Duration** - Overall amount of time taken to travel between cities 
in hours.

**Days left** - Subtracting the trip date by the booking date.

**Price** - Ticket price
## Project Overview

1. The project undergoes with key concepts in Predective Analysis
2. **Steps of a MACHINE LEARNING model**

**Step 1: Define the Problem**

Identify the target variable and the input features.

**Step 2: Data Loading**
Load the dataset into a DataFrame.

**Step 3: Data Exploration**

Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand the structure.

Check for null values and data types.

Generate summary statistics for numerical and categorical columns.

Visualize data distributions and relationships.

**Step 4: Data Cleaning**

Handle missing values:

Fill, replace, or drop missing data.

Remove duplicate rows.

Fix any incorrect or inconsistent values.

**Step 5: Feature Engineering**

Encode categorical variables (label encoding).

Drop unnecessary columns.

**Step 6: Model Selection and Training**

Select a regression model suitable for predicting charges (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

Train the model using the training data.

**Step 7: Model Evaluation**

Test the model on the testing data.

Evaluate performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.
